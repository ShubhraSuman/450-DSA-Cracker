1) Colourful image is 3-D. (R,G,B)
2) Size of image = Row * Column * 3 * 8bit.
3) High resolution means no. of rows and colums are more.
4) Video = 4D matrix
5) When passing a 2-D array, passsing column is compulsory.
6) How 2-D array is stored?
- Row major : Whole data is stored in one row.(Most common)
- Column major : Each column is put adjacent to each other.
7) 2-D Character array:
char number [][10] = {
    "One","Two","Three"
};
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
{
  cout<<number[i]<<endl;
}
output -> One, Two,Three  
- Here string is stored inside array.
- String itself is 1-D array.

8) Size of row and column of 2-D array
int rows = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
int cols = sizeof(arr[0])/sizeof(arr[0][0]);
